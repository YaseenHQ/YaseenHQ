Hi, I'm [@YaseenHQ](https://github.com/YaseenHQ), a Computer Science graduate student at NYU. I build halfway through some apps and leave it to collect dust and sometimes create a good app or two in process.

## 🔧 I Enjoy Working On:

- AI & ML applications in real-world contexts  
- Java/Python-powered software engineering  
- Research and evaluation of cutting-edge technologies  
- Open-source contributions and hackable prototypes  
  _→ Mostly pull requests for stuff I’d want to see in an app / testing and suggesting changes for the apps I use_  
  _(_**If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.**_)_

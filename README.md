Hi, I'm [@YaseenHQ](https://github.com/YaseenHQ), a Computer Science graduate student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I’m passionate about building secure, intelligent systems—whether it’s creating a password manager from scratch, exploring LLM performance for enterprises, or developing computer vision systems to enhance safety and interaction.

I enjoy working across the stack with a strong focus on:
- AI & ML applications in real-world contexts
- Java/Python-powered software engineering
- Research and evaluation of cutting-edge technologies
- Open-source contributions and hackable prototypes
